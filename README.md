# 🤖 Project Jarvis 1.0

> An AI-Powered Voice Assistant Built in Python for Dynamic Task Automation

---

## 📌 Overview

**Project Jarvis 1.0** is a smart desktop voice assistant created with Python. Inspired by Marvel's iconic J.A.R.V.I.S., this assistant interprets voice commands, learns from user interactions, and executes system tasks. Whether it's fetching your schedule, searching the web, or performing custom functions, Jarvis adapts to your needs and grows smarter over time.
